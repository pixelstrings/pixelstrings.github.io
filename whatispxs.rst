**History**
-----------

Pixel Strings is the newest product my Cinnafilm. Cinnafilm is a software company dedicated to making the the best images for film, broadcast, and web distribution leveraging the speed of the GPU to process in near realtime. It's core technologies are `Tachyon <http://cinnafilm.com/tachyon>`_ and `Dark Energy <http://cinnafilm.com/dark-energy-plug-in/>`_.

Pixel Strings brings together Cinnafilm's two main products in the cloud. This allows you to access the technology directly, vs using expensive transocidng infrastructure. Solve even the most challenging frame mechanics and image quality problems like conforming mixed frame rate input to a single frame rate output, removing broken cadence 3:2 pull down and mixed interlace/progressive material and removing video noise and film grain. Convert any frame rate to any frame rate with full motion compensation.
