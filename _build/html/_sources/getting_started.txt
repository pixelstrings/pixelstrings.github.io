How Pixel Strings differs
-------------------------

Traditionally, Cinnafilm's Tachyon and Dark Energy technologies could only be used through expensive third-party transcoders. But with the power of Pixel Strings, these capabilities have been brought forward to everyone.

The Process
-----------

Like a typical transcoder, Pixel Strings works in a 3-part process. 

1. Upload media
	* This is your ingest process. You footage goes into the cloud, where we do all of our processing.
2. Convert Media
	* This is where the magic happens. You choose your output framerate and resolution, and we do the rest.
3. Delivery
	* Deliver your output media back to a cloud service like AWS, or simply download the file locally.
