What is PixelStrings?
=====================

Pixel Strings will **clean up, fix, optimize,** and **convert** your video to create the best mezzanine master possible. Pixel Strings combines Cinnafilm's two main products (`Tachyon <http://cinnafilm.com/tachyon>`_ and `Dark Energy <http://cinnafilm.com/dark-energy-plug-in/>`_) in a cloud-based service. This allows you to access the technology directly, vs using expensive transocidng infrastructure. Solve even the most challenging frame mechanics and image quality problems like conforming mixed frame rate input to a single frame rate output, removing broken cadence 3:2 pull down and mixed interlace/progressive material and removing video noise and film grain. Convert any frame rate to any frame rate with full motion compensation.

The idea is to create all of your deliverables off this master mezzanine. We are not a transcoding service, but rather a fix-all service. All of the features of Pixel Strings fall into two main categories - Frame Mechanics and Optimization. 

Frame Mechanics Features:
	* Broken pulldown fixes
	* Motion Compensated Framerate conversions
	* NTSC to PAL (and vise versa)
	* Intermixed field dominance
	* Intermixed video correction
	* Deinterlacing
	* Low framerate conversions
	* Composited cadence errors

Optimization Features	
	* Smart image scaling
	* Automated scene-by-scene denoise
	* Cinema Quality re-grain
