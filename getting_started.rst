0. Getting Started
==================

Traditionally, Cinnafilm's Tachyon and Dark Energy plugins could only be used through expensive third-party transcoders. However, with the power of Pixel Strings, these capabilities have been brought forward to everyone.

The Process
-----------

Like a traditional transcoder, Pixel Strings works in a 3-part process. 

1. Upload media
	* This is your ingest process. You footage gets uploaded into the cloud, where we do all of our processing.
2. Convert Media
	* This is where the magic happens. You choose your output framerate, resolution, and features, and we do the rest.
3. Delivery
	* Once the conversion has completed, you can decide how to deliver your output media. You can download the file directly, or send to a cloud service like AWS.
